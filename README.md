# ccmenu2

This is work-in-progress of a complete rewrite of [CCMenu](https://github.com/erikdoe/ccmenu) in Swift/SwiftUI. It is not usable at this stage.



## Roadmap

- [ ] Alternative impl of app without MenuBarExtra dependency so that at least unit tests can run before Github supports Ventura
- [ ] Add/edit pipelines in pipeline window
- [ ] Persistent sorting of pipelines
- [ ] Remaining menu appearance options
- [ ] Notifications (check out: UNNotificationContentExtension)
- [ ] Basic auth login
- [ ] SSO login
